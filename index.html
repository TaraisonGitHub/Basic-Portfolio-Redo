				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<hr>
				<img src="assets/images/profile-pic.jpg">
				<p>Hello, I work as a Forms Programmer and I'm currently taking a bootcamp course
				to advance my career by becoming a full stack web developer. When I'm not building forms, I like
		        to go shopping and to try new places to eat. Sometimes you will also find me at home playing with my 
		        cats Lumi and Misty. I'm interested in martial arts and my proudest achievement is my black belt in Jeet Kune Do. I also pracice Silat, an Indonesian art, and Kali (stick and knife fighting).<br>
				My favorite foods are seafood, especially shrimp with cocktail sauce, but I also love chocolate desserts. My favorite drink is a Long Island. I'm also athletic and on the weekends I like to go hiking. I also like to be near the water, and my favorite beach is at Lido Key in Sarasota.
